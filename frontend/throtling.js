/**
 * 
 * Throttling is a technique used to control the execution of a 
 * function by limiting the number of times it can be
 *  called over a specific period of time. Unlike debouncing, 
 * which delays the execution of a function until a period of
 *  inactivity has passed, throttling ensures that a function 
 * is called at most once every t milliseconds, even if the function 
 * is triggered many times during that period.

This is particularly useful when you want to reduce the number of times
 a function is executed in response to high-frequency events like:

Window resizing
Scrolling
Mouse movement
Click events
